    "However receiving a response was in general really low and should be optimized. Get the graph sales_response\n",
    "2. Customers with a total claim amount between roughly 400 to 750 were most likely to respond. See graph tcm_response\n",
    "3. Customers with an income between 20.000 - 40.000 responsed the most. The more income the cusomter has the less likely they are to respond. See graph inc_response\n",
